# Model Evaluation and Validation

Essential techniques for assessing model performance including cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and bias-variance tradeoff. Students will implement evaluation metrics and learn to avoid overfitting through practical examples.

## Introduction

This chapter covers model evaluation and validation. Content will be added here.

## Code Example

```python
# Example code for Model Evaluation and Validation
print("Hello from Chapter 5!")
```


## Mathematical Concepts

Here's an example equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$
